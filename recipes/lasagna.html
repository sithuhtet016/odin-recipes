        <li>1 teaspoon dried basil leaves</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>16 oz ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>16 oz shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>
            In a large skillet over medium heat, cook the ground beef, onion, and garlic until the meat is browned. Drain any excess fat. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water. Season with sugar, basil, fennel seeds, Italian seasoning, salt, pepper, and parsley. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, parsley, and salt.
        </li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining salt, and parsley.</li>
        <li>
            Spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Place 6 noodles lengthwise over the meat sauce. Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a third of mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.
        </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes. For a crispy top, you can broil for an additional 2-3 minutes, keeping a close watch to avoid burning.
        </li>
        <li>Allow the lasagna to cool for about 15 minutes before serving. This helps it set and makes it easier to cut and serve.</li>
    </ol>
